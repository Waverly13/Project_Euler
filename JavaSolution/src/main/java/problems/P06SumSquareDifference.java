 * The sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers is,

 * The square of the sum of the first ten natural numbers is,
 *   (1 + 2 + ... + 10)^2 = 55POW2 = 3025
 * Hence the difference between the sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers and the square of the sum
 * is 3025 âˆ’ 385 = 2640.
 * Find the difference between the sum of the squares of the first one hundred natural numbers and the square of the sum.
